# React Package Starter

This is a simple app to demonstrate things that can be done with **AsteroidKit**

## Getting started

If you want to run this application locally all you need to do is to install dependencies and run dev script:

```console
yarn install
yarn dev
```

‚ùóImportant note: This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing dependencies. If you want to use another package manager, remove the `yarn.lock` and control-f for usages of `yarn` in the project and replace them with your package manager of choice.
